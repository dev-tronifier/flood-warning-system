## DETD Project for College
This is a prototype of an IoT (Internet of Things) based system, to be
implemented (with the help of sensors) across all Hydro Power Project Areas,
that will detect flooding and inform the public. It also aims to
predict areas where floods may occur and give Early Warning to public officials.
